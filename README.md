# Card Query Frontend

Card Queries is the frontend over an API made with FastAPI, a python library for making fast apis. The API
grants access to the dumps which are stored in a PostgreSQL database. At the moment, manually building queries
offers more access than the interface.

Card Queries is not meant to 1 to 1 map or even come close to r3n's card queries.
